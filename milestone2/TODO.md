# Two A4 pages describing the project goal

## Sketches of Visualizations
1. Put the dataset visualization on the wesite (allow users to choose axis(1-2 feature, poinous is always chosen), maybe the color of points to show the edibility)
2. Realize a little widget which illustrate the mushroom in realtime according to user's input (choose shape, slides size, etc.)

### Interactive Scatter Plot:

Description: Users can select different mushroom features from dropdown menus to visualize how these attributes correlate with mushroom edibility.

Sketch: Include a simple diagram showing a scatter plot with dropdown options for different features.

### Distribution Charts:

Description: Histograms or bar charts that display the distribution of mushrooms based on selected features like color, habitat, etc., segmented by edibility.

Sketch: Depict histograms segmented by color with controls for switching the feature.

### Geographical Map:

Description: A map showing locations where different types of mushrooms are commonly found, with filters for edibility and type.

Sketch: Map visualization with filters and hover-over effects for detailed information

## Tools and Resources

**Data Handling and Preprocessing**: Python, Pandas

**Data Visualization**: D3.js for interactive web visualizations, Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn) for preliminary data exploration

**Web Development**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript for front-end; Flask/Django for backend if necessary

**Hosting/Deployment**: GitHub Pages or Heroku

## Project Breakdown

### Core Visualization (Minimal Viable Product)
A basic interactive scatter plot that allows users to select features and visualize the correlation with mushroom edibility.
(Also need to show there's a strong correlation between the mushrooms' appearance and their poisoness)

Distribution charts showing the basic statistical breakdown of mushroom features like color and shape.

### Extra Ideas (Enhancements)

Advanced filtering options in the scatter plot and distribution charts to allow users to drill down into specific subcategories.
(Visualize the filter with a mushroom painted aside, to give the user's a intuitive feel for the look of the mushroom.)

Integration of a geographical map that adds an additional layer of data visualization showing the natural habitats of different mushrooms.


# Functional project prototype review
Prototype Requirements
- A basic website layout running locally or hosted online.
- Initial implementations of the scatter plot and distribution charts using dummy or preliminary real data.
- Basic navigation and user interface elements allowing users to interact with the visualizations.
